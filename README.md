## WEBCAM
A webcam is a digital camera that captures video and audio data and transmits it in real-time over the internet. It is commonly used for video conferencing, live streaming, online meetings, and recording videos.

We will use OpenCV and PyGame libraries.

Using OPENCV:

OpenCV library is compatible with the Linux and windows both operating system. Users need to install the OpenCV library on their local computer using the below command before they go ahead.

```Install command - pip install opencv-python```

APPROACH

1.import opencv library:

```import cv2```

2.define a video capture object:

```vid = cv2.VideoCapture(0) ```

3.loops for capturing the displaying frames:

```while(True):``` 
      
4.Capture the video frame by frame:

```ret, frame = vid.read()```

5.displaying the frame:

```cv2.imshow('frame', frame)```

6. checking for Quit result:

  if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'): 
   
   break

7. After the loop release the cap object, Destroy all the windows: 
   
   ```vid.release()```
